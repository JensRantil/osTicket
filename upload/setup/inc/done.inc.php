<h1>Important!</h1>
<P>Congratulations your new support ticket system is installed. Your next step is to fully configure your new support ticket system for use, but before you get to it please take a minute to cleanup.
<ul>
    <li><strong>Change permission of ost-config.php to remove write access</strong><br>
        chmod 644 include/ost-config.php</li>
    <li><strong>Delete setup directory</strong><br>
     After verifying that your installation completed correctly please delete setup folder.</li>
    <?php
     if(ini_get('register_globals')) { ?>
     <li><strong>Disable register globals (optional)</strong><br>
     If you don't have a good reason why register globals is enabled then please disable it.
     </li> 
    <?php
     }

     if(!function_exists('mcrypt_encrypt') || !function_exists('mcrypt_decrypt')) {?>
     <li><strong>Install/Enable cryptography extension mcrypt (optional)</strong><br>
       Cryptography extension mcrypt is not enabled or installed. IMAP/POP passwords will be stored as plain text in database.
     </li>
     <?php
     }?>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Post-Install Setup</h3>
<p>You can now log in to <a href="../scp/admin.php" target="_blank">Admin Panel</a> with the username and password you created during the install process. After a successful log in, you can proceed with post-install setup. For complete and upto date guide see <a href="http://osticket.com/wiki/Post-Install_Setup_Guide" target="_blank">osTicket wiki</a></p>
<p>Please note that the system is set to offline by default - as admin you can still login to <a href="../scp/admin.php" target="_blank">staff control panel</a>.
